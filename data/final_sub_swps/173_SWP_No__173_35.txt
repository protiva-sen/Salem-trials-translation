SWP No. 173.35

(Petition of
Samuel Nurse
for Restitution for
Rebecca Nurse
)
[September 13, 1710]
To the Honourable Committee Appointed to make Enquiry with respect to the Sufferings in the Tryalls in the year 1692
The humble Representation of Sam'll: Nurse of the damage sustained by our family in the year 1692 by reason of the Imprisonment condemnation and Execution of my Honoured Mother
Rebekah Nurse
for supposed Witchcraft
1 We were at the whole charge of provideing for her dureing her Imprisonm't in Salem and Boston for the space of almost four months
2 And also we spent much time and made many Journys to Boston & Salem & other places in order to have vindicated her Innocency.
3 And altho we produced plentifull testimony that my honoured and Dear mother had led a blameless life from her youth up -- yet she was condemned and executed upon such Evidence as is now Generally thought to be Insufficient, which may be seen in the court record of her tryall.
4 And so her Name and the name of her Posterity lyes under reproach the removeing of which reproach is the principal thing wherein we desire restitution.
5 And as we know not how to express our loss of such a mother in such a way; so we know not how to compute our charge but shall leave it to the judgm't. of others, and shall not be critical but ready to receive such a satisfaction as shall be by the Honourable Court judged sufficient -- so Praying God to Guide unto such Methods as may be for his Glory and the good of this land -- I rest
Your Honours In all christian obedience
*Sam'll Nurse
Salem  Septem. 13. 1710          In the name of my brethren
Altho fourty pounds would not repair my Loss and damage in my Estate, yet I shall be satisfyd if may be allowed five and twenty pounds. Provided the Attainder be taken off.
