Deacon Ingersoll's
. Q. Who was at
Deacon Ingersoll's
then? A.
Goody Cloyse
,
Goody Nurse
,
Goody Corey
, and
Goody Good

Sarah Cloyse
asked for water, and sat down as one seized with a dying fainting fit; and several of the afflicted fell into fits, and some of them cried out, Oh! her spirit is gone to prison to her sister
Nurse
. -- Q.
Elizabeth Procter
! you understand whereof you are charged, viz. to be guilty of sundry acts of witchcraft; what say you to it? Speak the truth, and so you that are afflicted, you must speak the truth, as you will answer it before God another day.

Abigail Williams
and
Ann Putman
were spoke to by the court, but neither of them could make any answer, by reason of dumbness or other fits. Q. What do you say
Goody Procter
to these things? A. I take God in heaven to be my witness, that I know nothing of it, no more than the child unborn. Q.
Ann Putman!
doth this woman hurt you. A. Yes Sir, a great many times. -- Then the accused looked upon them and they fell into fits. Q. She does not bring the book to you, does she? A. Yes, Sir, often, and saith she hath made her maid set her hand to it. Q.
Abigail Williams!
does this woman hurt you? A. Yes, Sir, often. Q. Does she bring the book to you? A. Yes. Q. What would she have you do with it? A. To write in it and I shall be well. -- Did not you, said Abigal, tell me, that your maid had written?
(Procter)
Dear Child, it is not so. There is another judgement, dear child. -- Then
Abigail
and
Ann
had fits. -- By and by they cried out, look you there is
Goody Procter
upon the beam. -- By and by, both of them cried out of
Goodman Procter
himself, and said he was a wizard. -- Immediately, many, if not all of the bewitched, had grievous fits. -- Q. Ann Putman! who hurt you? A.
Goodman Procter
and his wife too. -- Afterwards some of the afflicted cried, there is
Procter
going to take up
Mrs. Pope's
feet. -- And her feet were immediately taken up. -- Q. What do you say
Goodman Proctor
to these things? A. I know not, I am innocent. --
Abigail Williams
cried out, there is
Goodman Procter
going to
Mrs. Pope
, and immediately, said
Pope
fell into a fit. -- You see the devil will deceive you; the children could see what you was going to do before the woman was hurt. I would advise you to repentance, for the devil is bringing you out. --
Abigail Williams
cried out again, there is
Goodman Procter
going to hurt
Goody Bibber
; and immediately
Goody Bibber
fell into a fit. There was the like of
Mary Walcot
, and divers others. --
Benjamin Gould
gave in his testimony, that he had seen
Goodman Corey
and his wife,
Procter
and his wife,
Goody Cloyse
,
Goody Nurse
, and
Goody Griggs
in his chamber last thursday night. --
Elizabeth Hubbard
was in a trance during the whole examination. -- During the examination of
Elizabeth Procter
,
Abigail Williams
and
Ann Putman
,  both made offer to strike at said
Procter
; but when
Abigail's
hand came near, it opened, whereas it was made up into a fist before, and came done exceeding lightly, as it drew near to said
Procter
, and at length with open and extended fingers, touched
Procter's
hood very lightly. Immediately
Abigail
cried out, her fingers, her fingers, burned, and
Ann Putman
took on most greviously, of her head, and sunk down.
