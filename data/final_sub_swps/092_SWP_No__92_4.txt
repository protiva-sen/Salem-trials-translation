If I were such a person I would tell you the Truth
How comes your appearance just now to hurt these?
How do I know?
Are you not willing to tell the Truth?
I cannot tell: He that appeared in sams::shape can appear in any ones shape.
Do you beleive these afflicted persons do not say true?
they may lye for ought I know.
May not you lye?
I dare not tell a lye if it would save my life
Then you will not speak the truth will you?
I have spoken nothing else. I would do them any good.
I do not think that you have such affections for these whom just now you insinuated had the Devil for their Master

tho she had not accused her before: also
Mary Walcot
could not come near her.
John Indian

What is the reason these cannot come near you?
I cannot tell it may be the Devil bears me more malice than an other.
Do you not see God evidently discovering you?
No, not a bit for that.
All the congregation besides think so.
Let them think what they will.
What is the reason these cannot come to you?
I do not know but they can if they will or else if you please,
