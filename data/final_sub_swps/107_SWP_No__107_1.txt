Abig: Williams
complained of
Goodm Proctor
& cryed out w't are you come to, #[are you come to,] you can pinch as well as your wife & more to that purpose
6. At night she complained of
Goodm: Proctor
again & beat upon her breast & cryed he pinched her. The like I hear at
Tho. Putmans
house.
12. Day, When the Marshall was sent up to enquire of
John Proctor
& others & I was writing some what thereof as above I met with nothing but interruptions by reason of fits upon
John Indian
&
Abigail
, &
Mary Walcot
happening to come in just before, they one & another cryed out there is
Goodm: Proctor
very often: And
Abigail
said there is
Goodm: Proctor
in the Majstrats lap, at the same time
Mary Walcot
was sitting by a knitting we asked her if she saw
Goodm: Proctor
(for
Abigail
was immediately seized with a fit) but she was deaf & dumb, yet still a knitting, then
Mary
recovered her self & confirmed what
Abigail
had said that
goodm: proctor
she saw in the Majstrats lap Then
John
cryed out to the Dog under the Table to come away for
Goodm: Proctor
was upon his back, then he cryed out of
Goody Cloyse
, O you old Witch, & fell immediately into a violent fit that 3.men & the Marshall could not without exceeding difficulty hold him: In which fit
Mary Walcot
that was knitting & well composed said there was
Goodm: Proctor
& his wife &
Goody Cloyse
helping of him. But so great were the interruptions of
John
&
Abigail
by fits while we were observing these things to notify them, that we were fain to send them both away that I might have liberty to write this  without disturbance
Mary Walcot
abiding composed & knitting whilest I was writing & the two other sent away, yet by & by whilst I was writing Mary Walcot said there
Goody Cloyse
has pincht me now
Note.
Mary Walcot
never saw
Proctor
nor his wife till last night coming from the examination at Salem & then she saw
Goody Proctor
behind her brother Jonathan all the way from the
Widow Gidneys
to Phillips where Jonathan made a little stay But this day & time I have been writing this she saw them many times.
