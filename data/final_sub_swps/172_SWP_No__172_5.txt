To his Excellency the Governour, and Councill, and Representatives now in Generall Court Assembled;  at Boston:
The Petition of severall of the Inhabitants of Andover, Salem village & Topsfield, humbly sheweth:
That whereas in the year 1692 some of your Petitioners and the near Relations of others of them, viz:
Rebecca Nurse
,
Mary Estey
,
Abigail Faulkner
,
Mary Parker
, of Andover
John Procter
&
Elizabeth
his wife:
Elizabeth How
,
Samuel Wardwell
&
Sarah
his Wife: were accused of Witchcraft by certain possessed persons, and thereupon were apprehended and Imprisoned, and at a Court held at Salem were condemned upon the Evidence of the aforsaid possessed persons; and sentence of Death hath been executed on them (except
Abigail Faulkner
,
Elizabeth Procter
&
Sarah Wardwell
) of whose Innocency those that knew them are well satisfyed. And whereas the invalidity of the aforesaid Evidence and the great wrong which (through Errors & mistakes in those tryalls) was then done, hath since plainly appear'd which we doubt not but this Honored Court is sensible of: Your Petitioners  being dissatisfyed and grieved, that (besides what the aforesaid condemned persons have suffered in their persons and Estates) their Names are Exposed to Infamy and reproach, while their Tryall & condemnation stands upon Publick Record: We therefore humbly Pray this Honored Court, that something may be Publickly done to take off Infamy from the Names, and memory of those who have suffered as aforesaid, that none of their surviving Relations, nor their Posterity may suffer reproach upon that account. And yo'r
Petition'rs shall Ever pray &c.
