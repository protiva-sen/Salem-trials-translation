SWP No. 14.1

(Deposition of the
Rev. John Hale
v.
Sarah Bishop
)
[May 20, 1692 ]
John Hale
of Beverly aged about 56 yeares [tes[=testifies]] & saith that  about 5 or 6 years ago e Christian the wife of
John Trask
(living in  Salem bounds bordering on the abovesaid Beverly) beeing in full  comunion in o'r Church came to me to desier that
Goodwife Bishop
her Neighb'r wife of
Edw: Bishop Jun'r
might not be permitted to receive the Lords Supper in our church till she had given her the said Trask satisfaction for some offences that were against her.viz because the said
Bishop
did entertaine people in her house at unseasonable houres in the night to keep drinking and playing at shovel-board whereby discord did arise in other families & young people were in danger to bee corrupted & that the s'd
Trask
knew these things & had once gon into the house & fynding some at shovel-board had taken the peices thay played with & thrown them into the fyre  & had reprooved the said
Bishop
for promoting such disorders, But received no satisfaction from her about it.
I gave s'd
Christian Trask
direction how to proceed farther in  this matter if it were clearly prooved And indeed by the information  I have had otherwise I doe fear that if a stop had not been putt to  those disorders s'd
Edw. Bishop's
house would have been a house of  great prophainness & iniquity. But as to
Christian Trask
the next news I heard of her was that  she was distracted & asking her
husband Trask
when she was so taken [he told] mee shee was taken distracted that night after shee [came from] my house when shee complained against
Goody Bishop
. She continueing some time Distracted wee sought the Lord by fasting & prayer & the Lord was pleased to restore the s'd
[Trask]
to the use of her reason agen. I was s'th her often in [her] distraction  (& took it then to bee only distraction, yet fearing sometimes  somw't worse) but since I have seen the fitts of those bewitched at Salem Village I call to mind some of hers to be much like some of theirs.
The said
Trask
when recovered as I understood it did manifest  strong suspicion that shee had been bewitched by the s'd
Bishop's
wife & showed so much aversness from having any conversation that  I was then troubled at it hopeing better of s'd
Goody Bishop
at that  time for wee have since [torn] At length s'd
Christian Trask
[was] agen in a distracted fit on a Sabboth day in the forenoon at the publ[i]ck meeting to o'r public desturbance & so continued sometimes  better sometimes worse unto her death, manifesting that shee under temptation to kill her selfe or somebody else. I enquired of
Marg'rt Ring
who kept at or nigh the house, what  shee had observed of s'd
Trask
before this last distraction shee told  [mee.]
Goody Trask
was much given to reading & search the prophecys of scrip[ture]. The day before shee made that disturbance in the meeting [house she[e] came home & said shee had been w'th
Goody Bishop
& that they two were now friend or to that effect.
I was oft praying w'th & councelling of
Goody Trask
before her death and not many days before her end being there shee seemed  more rationall & earnestly desired
Edw: Bishop
might be sent for that shee might make friends with him, I asked her if shee had  wronged
Edw. Bishop
shee said not that shee knew of unless it were in taking his shovel-board pieces when people were at play w'th them & throwing them into the fyre & if she did evill in it she was very sorry for it & desiered he would be friends with her or forgive her.  this was the very day before she dyed, or a few days before. Her distraction (or bewitching) continued about a month and in those intervalls wherein shee was better shee earnestly desired prayers & the Sabboth befere she dyed I received a note for prayers on her behalf w'ch her husband said was written by her selfe & I judge was her owne hand writing beeing well acquainted with her hand. As to the wounds she dyed of I observed 3 deadly ones; apeice of her wind pipe cutt out. & another wound above that threww the windpipe & Gullet & the veine they call jugular. So that I then judge  & still doe apprehend it impossible for her w'th so short a pair of cissars to mangle her selfe so without some extraordinary work of the devill or witchcraft signed. 20. may 1692  by
*John Hale.
