After many questiones and negative answe's returned and her stricking down of severall of the afflicted persones with her looks, she was desired to tell the truth in this matter She then said that this may last she was under great discontentedness & troubled w'h feare about the Indians, & used often to dream of figheting with them. Being asked what was the devils temptation under her discontentm't She said she would confess if she could But that there was something at her breast that hindered her. she said she had often prayed but thought she was the worse for prayeing and knows not but that the devil hes tempted her not to pray, for #(my) her breath has been often stopt as it was just now; Being asked if the devil did not Desier her to renounce her baptisme, she answered that she had thoughts she was rather the worse for her baptisme and has wished she had not been baptised because she had not improved it as she ought to have done She saith she used to get into a corner alone and desired to pray but her mouth would be stopt but sometymes she had been helped to say Lord be mercifull to me a sinner. Being again asked how far she had yeilded to Satan she said the devil promised her she should not be discovered and if she wer discovered & brought down that she should goe home Innocent & cleare but now find he hes deluded her Being again asked how long it is since Satan first wrought with her in this manner she said she could not well tell how long but thinks it is not two year(s)

to Timothy Swans,
and did often think of him &  her hands would be clinched together, And that she would grip the dishclout or any #(thgelee) thing else. and so think of the persone; And by this & afflicting of othe's since she came down she is convinced she is a witch -- she saith now, the devil appeared to her in the shape of a Tawny man and promeised to keep her from the Indians & she should have happy dayes with her sone -- she was asked if she did not signe the devills book; answered he brought something which she took to be a peece of burch bark, and she made a mark with her finger by rubbing off the whit Scurff. And he promised if she would serve him she should be safe from the Indians (she was then a litle stopt again & believed it was the devil that did it) Being asked if the Devil did not say she was to serve him Answered yes, and signed the mark upon that condition and was to praise him w'h her whole heart, And it was to that appearance she prayed at all tymes for he said he was able to delyver her from the Indians And it was the feare of the Indians that put her upon it
