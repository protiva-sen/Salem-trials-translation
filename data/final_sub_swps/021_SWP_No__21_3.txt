These may Certifye whom it may
These are to Certyfye whom it may or shall concerne that I have  known
Sarah
the wife of
William Buckly
of Salem village more or less: ever since she was #[borut] brought out of England w'ch is  above fifty years agoe and during all the time I never knew nor heard of any evill in her carriage or conversation unbecomming a christian:  likewise she was bred up by christian parents all the time she lived  here att Ipswich I further Tasiffye that the said
Sarah
was admitted  as a member into the church of Ipswich above forty years since: and  that I never heard from others or observed by my selfe any thing of  her that was inconsistent with her profession or unsuitable to christianity either in word deed or conversation and am straingly surprized  that any person should speake or thinke of her as one worthy to be  susspicted of any such crime that she is now charged with in testimony hereof I have here sett my hand this 20'th of June 1692
