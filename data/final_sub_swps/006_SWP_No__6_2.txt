SWP No. 6.2

(Examination of
John Alden
, as Published by Robert Calef)
[May 31, 1692 ]
John Aldin Senior
, of Boston, in the County of Suffolk, Mariner, on the 28th Day of May, 1692, was sent for by the Magistrates of Salem, in the County of Essex, upon the Accusation of a  company of poor distracted, or possessed Creatures or Witches;  and being sent by
Mr. Stoughton
, arrived there the 31st of May,  and appeared at Salem-Village, before
Mr. Gidney
,
Mr. Hathorn,
and
Mr. Curwin.
Those Wenches being present, who plaid their jugling tricks,  falling down, crying out, and staring in Peoples Faces; the Magi-  strates demanded of them several times, who it was of all the People  in the Room that hurt them? one of these Accusers pointed several  times at one
Captain Hill
, there present, but spake nothing; the  same Accuser had a Man standing at her back to hold her up; he  stooped down to her Ear, then she cried out,
Aldin
,
Aldin
afflicted  her; one of the Magistrates asked her if she had ever seen
Aldin
,  she answered no, he asked her how she knew it was
Aldin
? She  said, the Man told her so.
Then all were ordered to go down into the Street, where a Ring  was made; and the same Accuser cried out, “there stands
Aldin
, a  bold fellow with his Hat on before the Judges, he sells Powder and  Shot to the Indians and French, and lies with the Indian Squaes,  and has Indian Papooses.” Then was
Aldin
committed to the Marshal's  Custody, and his Sword taken from him; for they said he afflicted  them with his Sword. After some hours
Aldin
was sent for to the  Meeting-house in the Village before the Magistrates; who required
Aldin
to stand upon a Chair, to the open view of all the People.
The Accusers cried out that
Aldin
did pinch them, then, when  he stood upon the Chair, in the sight of all the People, a good way  distant from them, one of the Magistrates bid the Marshal to hold  open
Aldin's
hands, that he might not pinch those Creatures.
Aldin
asked them why they should think that he should come to that  Village to afflict those persons that he never knew or saw before?
Mr. Gidney
bid
Aldin
confess, and give glory to God;
Aldin
said he hoped he should give glory to God, and hoped he should never gratifie the Devil; but appealed to all that ever knew him, if they ever suspected him to be such a person, and challenged any one, that could bring in any thing upon their own knowledge, that might give suspicion of his being such an one.
Mr. Gidney
said he had known
Aldin
many Years, and had been at Sea with him, and al-  ways look'd upon him to be an honest Man, but now he did see cause  to alter his judgment:
Aldin
answered, he was sorry for that, but he hoped God would clear up his Innocency, that he would recall  that judgment again, and added that he hoped that he should with  Job maintain his Integrity till he died. They bid
Aldin
look upon the Accusers, which he did, and then they fell down.
Aldin
asked
Mr. Gidney
, what Reason there could be given, why
Aldin's
looking  upon him did not strike him  down as well; but no reason was given  that I heard. But the Accusers were brought to
Aldin
to touch them, and this touch they said made them well.
Aldin
began to speak of the Providence of God in suffering these Creatures to accuse Innocent persons.
Mr. Noyes
asked
Aldin
why he would offer to speak of the Providence of God. God by his Providence (said
Mr. Noyes
) governs the World, and keeps it in peace; and so went on with Discourse, and stopt
Aldin's
mouth, as to that.
Aldin
told
Mr. Gidney
, that he could assure him that there was a lying Spirit in them, for I  can assure you that there is not a word of truth in all these say of me. But
Aldin
was again committed to the Marshal, and his Mittimus  written, which was as follows.
