Mercy Lewes
. Why do you threaten they should be Rubb'd?
I did not speak a word of Rubbing.
Many testifyed she did.
My meaning was God would bring things to light.
Your meaning for God to bring the thing to light would be to deliver these poor afflicted ones, that would not Rubb them.

I know not.
They were rubbed after you had threatened them.
