(Deposition of
Thomas Nelson
Vs.
Margaret Scott
)
[September 15, 1692]
The Deposition of
Thomas Nelson
, who saith, that, about six yeares ago the last winter,
Margaret Scot
, of Rowley, widow, desired me to bring her some wood, and spake to me severall times for wood, and I told her, that I owed her ten shillings and I would bring her wood for it, and she was not willing to set of that. Earnest she was for me to bring her wood: denied her; soon after this one of my cattell was dead in the stantiall, and stood up on his hind feet, and kneeled on his knees afore, and little after this another of my cattell was ded in the yard, his neck under a plank at the barn side as if he were chok'd; and after this, and ever since, had hard thoughts of this woman and my neighbours told me, something more then ordinery that my cattell died so. And I do verily believe that she is a witch.
