[+ September 14, 1692]
The Testimony of
Charity Pitman
of Marblehead.
This deponent aged twenty nine years affirms, that about five years agoe,
M'rs Syms
of the Towne having lost some linnen which she suspected
Martha Laurence
the girle which then lived with
Wilmott Redd
had taken up, desired the deponent to goe with her to
Wilmott Redds
, and demanding the same, having many words about the same,
M'rs Syms
told her, that if she would not deliver them she would go to Salem to
mr Hathorne
, and gett a speciall warrant for her servant girle; upon which the s'd
Redd
told her in my hearing, that she wished that she might never mingere [urinate], nor cacare [defecate], if she did not goe, and some short time after the deponent observed that the s'd
M'rs Syms
was taken with the distemper of the dry Belly=ake, and so continued many moneths during her stay in the Towne, and was not cured whilst she tarryed in the Countrey, -
