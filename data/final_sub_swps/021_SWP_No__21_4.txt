[January 2, 1693]
Being desired by
goodman Buckly
to give my testimony to his  wives conversation before this great Calamity befell her, I cannot refuse to bear witnes to the truth, viz that during the time of her  living in Salem for many years in Communion with this Church having occasionally frequent converse & discourse with her, I have  never observed my selfe nor heard from any other any thing that  was unsuitable to a Conversation becoming the Gospel; & have allwayes looked upon her as a serious Godly woman
