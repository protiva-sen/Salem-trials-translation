she was struck [down?]
I cannot help it.
You are chargid here; what doe you say?
I am innocent of any thing of this nature.
Is this the first time that ever you were accused?
Yes S'r.

This is the first time that ever I heard of it

Have not you seen some apparition --

What do you say to these things, they cannot come to you?
S'r. I am not able to give account of it
Cannot you tell what keeps them off from your body?
I cannot tell, I know not what it is?
That is strange that you should do these things & not be able to tell how.
