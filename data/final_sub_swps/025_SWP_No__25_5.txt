[July 22, 1692]
We met in a green, which was the minister's pasture - we were in two companies at last. I think there was a few men with them. - I heard
Sarah Good
talk of a minister or two. One of them was she that had been at the eastward; his name is
Burroughs
, and is a little man. -I remember not the other's name.
