[April 21, 1692 ]
Salem Village , this 21'st of April, 1692   Much honored:
After most humble and hearty thanks presented to your Honors  for the great care and pains you have already taken for us, for which  we are never able to make you recompense (and we believe you do not expect it of us; therefore a full reward will be given you of the  Lord God of Israel, whose cause and interest you have espoused,  and we trust this shall add to your crown of glory in the day of the  Lord Jesus); and we, beholding continually the tremendous works of  divine providence -- not only every day but every hour -- thought it our duty to inform your Honors of what we conceive you have not heard, which are high and dreadful: of a wheel within a wheel,  at which our ears do tingle.
Humbly craving continually your prayers and help in this distressed case, so praying almighty God continually to prepare you,   that you may be a terror to evil-doers and a praise to them that do well, we remain yours to serve in what we are able.
Thomas Putnam
