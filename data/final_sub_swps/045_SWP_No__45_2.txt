Goody Hobbs
.
What do you say, are you guilty?
I can say before Christ Jesus, I am free.
You see these accuse you.
There is a God --
Hath she brought the book to you?
Their mouths were stopt.
What have you done to these children?
I know nothing.
How can you say you know nothing, when you see these tormented, & accuse you that you know nothing?
Would you have me accuse my self?
Yes if you be guilty.
How far have you complyed w'th Satan whereby he takes this  advantage ag't you?
Sir, I never complyed but prayed against him all my dayes, I  have no complyance with Satan, in this. What would you have  me do?
Confess if you be guilty.
I will say it, if it was my last time, I am clear of this sin.
Of what sin?
Of witchcraft.
Are you certain this is the woman?
Never a one could speak for fits.
By and by
Ann Putman
said that was the woman, it was like her,  & she told me her name;
It is marvailous to me that #[she] you should sometimes think  they are bewitcht, & sometimes not, when severall confess that they  have been guilty of bewitching them.
Well Sir would you have me confess that that I never knew?
Her hands were clincht together, & then the hands of
Mercy Lewis
was clincht
Look now you hands are open, her hands are open.
Is this the woman?
They made signes but could not speak, but
Ann Putman
afterwards
Betty Hubbard
cryed out Oh.
Goody Easty
,
Goody Easty
you  are the woman, you are the woman
Put up her head, for while her head is bowed the necks of these  are broken.
What do you say to this?
Why God will know.
Nay God knows now.
I know he dos.
What did you think of the actions of others before your sisters  came out, did you think it was Witchcraft?
I cannot tell.
Why do you not think it is Witchcraft?
It is an evil spirit, but wither it be witchcraft I do not know,  Severall said she brought them the Book & then they fell into fits.
