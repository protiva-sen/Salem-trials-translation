SWP No. 37.12

(Letter from
Thomas Putnam
to Judge
Samuel Sewall
, an "Extract")
The Last Night my Daughter
Ann
was grievously Tormented by Witches, Threatning that she should be Pressed to Death, before
Giles Cory
. But thro' the Goodness of a Gracious God, she had at last a  little Respite. Whereupon there appeared unto her (she said) a man in a Winding Sheet; who told her that
Giles Cory
had Murdered him, by Pressing him to Death with his Feet; but that the Devil there  appeared unto him, and Covenented with him, and promised him, He should not be Hanged. The Apparition said, God Hardened his  Heart, that he should not hearken to the Advice of the Court, and so  Dy an easy Death; because as it said, “It must be done to him as he  has done to me.” The Apparition also said, That
Giles Cory
was  Carry'd to the Court for this, and that the Jury had found the  Murder, and that her Father knew the man, and the thing was done before she was born. Now Sir, This is not a little strange to us; that no body should Remember these things, all the while that
Giles Cory
was in Prison, and so often before the Court. For all people now Remember very well, (and the Records of the Court also mention it,) That about Seventeen Years ago,
Giles Cory
kept a man  in his House, that was almost a Natural Fool: which Man Dy'd suddenly. A Jury was Impannel'd upon him, among whom was
Dr. Zorobbabel Endicot
; who found the man bruised to Death, and having clodders of Blood about his Heart. The Jury, whereof several are yet alive, brought in the man Murdered; but as if some Enchantment had hindred the Prosecution of the Matter, the Court  Proceeded not against
Giles Cory
, tho' it cost him a great deal of Mony to get off.
