Gentlemen,
I Thought it meet to give you this broken account, hoping it may be of
some service. I am wholly unacquainted with affairs of this nature neither have
the benefit of books for forms &c. but being unadvisedly entered upon service I
am wholly unfit for, beg that my ignorance and failings may be as much covered
as conveniently may be; which will ever be acknowledged by
Your poor and unworthy servant,
DUDLEY BRADSTREET.
I know not whether to make any returns. Bonds I have taken. The custos rotulorum I know not, &c.
To the Honoured Bartholomew Gedney, John Hathorne, Esq., or any of their Majestiesâ€™ Justices of the Peace
in Salem these humbly present.
