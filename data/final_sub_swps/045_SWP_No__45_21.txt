SWP No. 45.21

(Petition of
Mary Esty
and
Sarah Cloyce
)
[++ September 9, 1692]
The humble Request of
Mary Esty
and
Sarah Cloys
to the Honoured Court.
Humbly sheweth, that whereas we two Sisters
Mary Esty
&
Sarah Cloys
stand now before the Honoured court charged with the  suspition of Witchcraft, our humble request is first that seing we are  neither able to plead our owne cause, nor is councell alowed to those in our condicion; that you who are our Judges, would please to be of councell to us, to direct us wherein we may stand in neede.  Secondly that whereas we are not conscious to ourselves of any  guilt in the least degree of that crime, wherof we are now accused  (in the presence of the Living God we speake it, before whose awfull Tribunall we know we shall ere Long appeare) nor of any other scandalouse evill, or miscaryage inconsistant with Christianity, Those  who have had the Longest and best knowledge of us, being persons of good report, may be suffered to Testifie upon oath what they know concerning each of us, viz
Mr. Capen
the pastour and those of  the Towne & Church of Topsfield, who are ready to say somthing  which we hope may be looked upon, as very considerable in this  matter; with the seven children of one of us, viz
Mary Esty
, and it may be produced of Like nature in reference to the wife of
Peter Cloys
, her sister. Thirdly that the Testimony of witches, or such as are afflicted, as is supposed, by witches may not be improved to condemn us, without other Legal evidence concurring, we hope the Honoured Court & Jury will be soe tender of the lives of such,  as we are who have for many years Lived under the unblemished reputation of Christianity, as not to condemne them without a fayre and equall hearing of what may be sayd for us, as well as against us. And your poore supplyants shall be bound always to pray &c.
