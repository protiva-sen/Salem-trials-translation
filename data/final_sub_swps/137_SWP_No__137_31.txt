( Deposition of
Bray Wilkins
v.
John Willard
)
[++ August 4, 1692]
The Deposition of
Bray Wilkins
of Salem Village aged about eighty & one years with reference to
John Willard
of s'd Salem, lately charged with Witchcraft, when he was at first complained of by the afflicted persons for afflicting of them he came to my house greatly troubled, desiring me with some other Neighbours to pray for him: I told him I was then going from home, & could not stay, but if I could come home before night I should not be unwilling, but it was near night before I came home & so I did not answere his desire, but I heard no more of him upon that account. Whither my not answering his desire did not offend him, I cannot tell, but I was jealous afterwards that it did. A little after my wife & I went to Boston at the last Election, when I was as well in health as in many yeares before, & the Election day coming to my brother Lf't
Richard Way's
house, at noon there were many friends to dine there, they were sat down at the Table,
Mr Lawson
& his wife & severall more,
John Willard
came into the house with my sone
Henry Wilkins
before I sat down, & s'd
Willard
to my apprehension lookt after such a sort upon me as I never before discerned in any, I did but step into the next room, & I was presently taken in a strange condition, so that I could not dine, nor eat any thing, I cannot express the misery I was in for my water was sodainly stopt, & I had no benefit of nature, but was like a man on a #(wrack) Rack, & I told my wife immediately that I was afraid that
Willard
had done me wrong, my pain continuing & finding no relief my jealousie continued:
Mr Lawson,
& others there, were all amazed, & knew not what to do for me: There was a Woman accounted  skilfull came hoping to help me, & after she had used means, she askt me whither none of those evil persons had done me damage. I said, I could not say they had, but I was sore afraid they had, she answered she did fear so too, as near as I remember. I lay in this case .3. or. .4. dayes at Boston, & afterwards with the jeopardy of my life (as I thought) I came home, & then some of my friends coming to #(se) see me (& at this time
John Willard
was run away) One of the afflicted persons
Mercy Lewes
came in with them, & they askt whither she saw any thing: She said yes, they are looking for
John Willard
but there he is upon his Grandfathers Belly (& at that time I was in greivius #(parts) pain in the small of my Belly) #(I sent my) I continued so in greivous pain & my water much stopt till s'd
Willard
was in chains, & then as near as I can guess I had considerable ease, but on the other hand in the room of a stoppage, I was vexed with a flowing of water, so that it was hard to keep my self dry. On the .5. July last talking with some friends about
John Willard
some pleading his innocency & my self & some others arguing the contrary, within about 1/4 of an hour after that I had said it was not I, nor my son
Benj'n Wilkins
, but the testimony of the afflicted persons, & the jury concerning the Murder of my Grandson
Dan: Wilkins
that would take away his life if any thing did, & within about 1/4 hour after this was taken in the sorest distress & misery my water being turned into real blood, or of a bloody colour & the old pain returned excessively as before which continued for about 24. houres together
