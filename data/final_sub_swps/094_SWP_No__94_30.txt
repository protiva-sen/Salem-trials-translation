( Deposition of
Sarah Stephens
and
Margery Pasque
v. Rebecca Nurse,
Sarah Cloyce
, &
Mary Black
)
[++ June 29, 1692]
The Deposition of
Sarah Stephens
aged [] &
Margery Pasque
aged [] testify that the 21 June Last past being improved in the holding of
Jemima Rea
sodainly seized with strange fitts, they heard the said
Jemima
in her fitts cry out much upon
Goody Nurse,
Goody Cloyce
&
Goody Black
, & said, What you cannot do it alone, & you brought this woman [to] help you: Why did you bring her? She was never complained of.
Goody Cloyce
(as these Deponents suppose) answered that the Devil would not suffer her any longer to be a Witch, she must be brought out: And the said
Jemima
complained that
Goody Cloyce
Pricks & Pinches her, and the said
Jemima
(as they understood by her discourse) was told by the said
Cloyce
that one Lords day when she run out of the meeting house from the Sacrament in a great rage, had her Master met her at the garrison gate just before the Fore-doer of the meeting house, to which Master she made a Courtesy, & at that time set her hand to his book & when she took her leave of him she made another Courtesy And farther these Deponents say that the said
Jemima
spake to this purpose in six or seven fits one after another, & that the said
Cloyce
had done, & bid these two deponents hold her hands that she might not so do; & also the said
Jemima
when recovered of her fits confirmed what she had spoken in her fits to these Deponents & further saith not.
