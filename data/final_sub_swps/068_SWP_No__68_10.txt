(Testimony of the
John Hale
v.
Dorcas Hoar
)
[September 6, 1692 ]
John Hale
aged 56 yeares Testifieth 6. 7. 1692
That for severall yeares agoe formerly were storys told concerning
Dorcas Hoar
her beeing a fortune teller. And that shee had told her owne fortune, viz that she should live poorely so long as her husband
willm Hoar
did live, but the said will should dye before her, & after that shee should live better. Allso the fortune of
Ens: Corning
& his wife who should dye.first & that shee had had a book of fortune telling. About twenty two yeares agoe the s'd
Dorcas
manifested to me great repentance for the sins of her former life & that she had borrowed a book of Palmstry, & there were rules to know what should come to pass. But I telling her that it was an evill book & evill art shee seemed to me to renounce, or reject all such practices; whereupon I had great charity for her severall yeares. But 14 yeares agoe last spring I discovered an evill practice had been between a servant of mine & some of sd
Hoars
children in conveying goods out of my house to the s'd
Hoars
. and I had a daughter
Rebecca
then between 11 & 12 years old, whome I asked if she knew of the
Hoars
stealing: she told me yea, But durst not reveale it to me, & one reason was, She was threatened that
Goody Hoar
was a witch & had a book by w'ch shee could tell what s'd
Rebecca
did tell me in my house & if the s'd
Rebecca
told me of the stealing, the said
Hoar
would raise the devill to kill her, or bewitch her, or words to that effect. (but whether she said that
Dorcas
her selfe or her chilldren told
Rebecca
those words I remember not) I asked
Rebecca
if she saw the book she said yea, she was shewed that book & their were many streaks & pictures in it by w'ch (as she was told) the said
Hoar
could reveale secretes & work witchcrafts. I asked her how big the book was, she said it was like a gramer, that lay on the table. And said shee now I have told you of the stealing
Goody Hoar
will bewitch me. I perswaded my daughter not to think so hardly of
Goody Hoar
. But she replyed I know
Goody Hoar
is a witch (or to the effect) & then told storys of strange things that had been acted in or about my house, when I & my wife were abroad to fright sd
Rebecca
into silence about the theft, w'ch sd
Rebecca
judged to be acts of s'd
Hoars
witchcraft the particulars I have now forgotten. I called to minde that the sd
Hoar
had told me of a book of palmstry she had, but not the bigness of it; therefore that I might be better satisfyed I asked
Thomas Tuck
if he knew
Goody Hoar
to have a book of fortune telling & he said yea shee had, such a kind of book w'ch he had seen w'th streaks & pictures in it and that it was about the bigness of such a book poynting to a gramer, or book of like magnitude. this confirmed me in the opinion that my daughter had seen such a book. And after my daughters death a freind told me that my daughter said to her shee went in fear of her life by the Hoars till quieted by the script'r. Fear not them w'ch can kill the boady &c.

About those times other things were spoken of the sd
Hoares
suspicians of her witchcraft whereupon a frend of mine did as I was informed acquaint Maj'r Denison w'th them, for his consideration & as I was informed Maj'r Denison took an opportunity to examine sd W'm Hoare about a fortune book his wife had &
W'm Hoar
answered the book was
John Samsons
& his wife had returned the  book long agoe & so the matter was left for that time. When discourses revived of
Goody Hoars
fortune telling of later times, & she beeing comited to Boston I did last may speak w'th her of may things that I had known & heard of her. Shee told me that he owne fortune that she spake of, She was told by a shipmaster when she was first marryed. &
Ens: Corning
fortune viz that his first wife should dye before him (w'ch is since come to pass) she sapke it from observing a certain streak under the eye of sd
Corning
or his wife: But as I take it it was his wife had the streak. And for seeing the devill, or any spirit but ones, & that was soon after old
Thomas Tuck
dyed (w'ch I take to be about ten yeare since) & that shee took it to be the Ghost of
Thom: tuck
coming to speak w'th her about some land sd
Tuck
had told her of before his death. But that shee fled from the Ghost & got away.
The fortune book she said was about the bigness of a childs Psalter (w'ch agrees w'th that of a gramer) But owned no other but that of
John Samsons
w'ch he had from her as she said above 20 years agoe & that shee had not told fortunes since the time I had layed before her the evill of it. w'ch is about 20 or 22 years since. I lately spake w'th
John Samson
& he told me that he had a book of Palmstry when he lived at
Goody Hoars
w'ch shee had seen: but that it was a book in quarto. & he sold it at Casco-Bay about 30 yeares since & had not seen it since
