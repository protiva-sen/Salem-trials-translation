[** September 13, 1710]
To the Comittee Appointed to Distribute the money allowed to the Sufferers in 1692......
Gent.
I request the favour of you to represent it to the Gen'll Court what a great Sufferer I have been in my Estate by reason of the Severe prosecution of me & my wife in that Dark time. It Cost me fifty pounds at Boston & we were forced to fly for our Lives at which time my Estate was Seised & Squandred away to a great Value & much of my provision used to Subsist the numerous Company of prisoners -- In the whole I am Exceedingly Damnifyed the most of  my personal Estate to the Value of many hundreds of pounds taken from me & Very Little of it Restored againe I pray to Consider my Extroardinary Sufferings
I am Gent yo'r Serva.
