<p>[October 19, 1692]</p>
<p><a href="/tag/osgood_mary.html">Mrs. Osgood</a> freely and relentingly said, that the confession which she made upon her examination for witchcraft, and afterwards acknowledged before the honourable judges, was<br>
wholly false, and that she was brought to the said confession by the violent urging and<br>
unreasonable pressings that were used toward her; she asserted that she never signed to the<br>
devill’s book, was never baptised by the devill, never afflicted any of the accusers, or gave her<br>
consent for their being afflicted. Being asked, why she prefixed a time and spake of her being<br>
baptised, &amp;c.: about twelve years since; she replyed, and said, that when she had owned the<br>
thing, they asked the time; to which she answered, that she knew not the time; but being<br>
told that she did know the time and must tell the time, and the like; she considered that<br>
about twelve years before (when she had her last child) she had a fitt of sicknesse, and was<br>
melancholy; and so thought that that time might be as proper a time to mention as any, and<br>
accordingly did prefix the said time.</p>
<p>Being asked about the cat, in the shape of which she had confessed the devill appeared to<br>
her, &c.; she replyed, that being told that the devill had appeared to her, and must needs<br>
appear to her, &c.; (she being a witch) she at length did own that the devill had appeared to<br>
her; and being press’d to say in what creature’s shape he appeared in, she at length did say,<br>
that it was in the shape of a cat; remembering that some time before her being apprehended,<br>
as she went out at her door, she saw a cat, &amp;c.: not as though she any whitt suspected the<br>
said cat to be the devill in the day of *** but because some creature she must mention, and<br>
this came thus into her mind at that time.</p>
<p>Deacon Fry’s wife said, that the confession she made she was frighted into, and that it<br>
was all of it false.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dean and Goodwife Barker said freely, that they had wronged the truth in making<br>
their confession; that they in their lives time never covenanted with the devill, or had seen<br>
him; that they were press’d, and urg’d, and affrighted; that at last they did say even any thing<br>
that was desired of them; they said that they were sensible of their great evill in giving way at<br>
last to own what was false, and spake all with such weeping, relenting, and bleeding, as was<br>
enough to affect the hardest heart; particularly G. Barker bewail’d and lamented her accusing<br>
of others, whom she never knew any evill by in her life time; and said that she was told by her<br>
examiners that she did know of their being witches and must confesse it; that she did know of<br>
their being baptised, &amp;c.: and must confesse it; by the renewed urgings and chargings of whom at last she gave way, and owned such things as were utterly false, which now she was<br>
in great horrour and anguish of soul for her complying with.</p>
<p>Goodwife Tyler did say, that when she was first apprehended, she had no fears upon her,<br>
and did think that nothing could have made her confesse against herself; but since, she had<br>
found to her great grief, that she had wronged the truth, and falsely accused herself: she said,<br>
that when she was brought to Salem, her brother Bridges rode with her, and that all along<br>
the way from Andover to Salem, her brother kept telling her that she must needs be a witch,<br>
since the afflicted accused her, and at her touch were raised out of their fitts, and urging her<br>
to confess herself a witch; she as constantly told him, that she was no witch, that she knew<br>
nothing of witchcraft, and begg’d of him not to urge her to confesse; however when she came<br>
to Salem, she was carried to a room, where her brother on one side and Mr. John Emerson<br>
on the other side did tell her that she was certainly a witch, and that she saw the devill before<br>
her eyes at that time (and accordingly the said Emerson would attempt with his hand to beat<br>
him away from her eyes) and they so urged her to confesse, that she wished herself in any<br>
dungeon, rather than be so treated: Mr. Emerson told her once and again, Well! I see you<br>
will not confesse! Well! I will now leave you, and then you are undone, body and soul<br>
forever: Her brother urged her to confesse, and told her that in so doing she could not lye; to<br>
which she answered, Good brother, do not say so, for I shall lye if I confesse, and then who<br>
shall answer unto God for my lye? He still asserted it, and said that God would not suffer so<br>
many good men to be in such an errour about it, and that she would be hang’d, if she did not<br>
confesse, and continued so long and so violently to urge and presse her to confesse, that she<br>
thought verily her life would have gone from her, and became so terrifyed in her mind, that<br>
she own’d at length almost any thing that they propounded to her; but she had wronged her<br>
conscience in so doing, she was guilty of a great sin in belying of herself, and desired to<br>
mourn for it as long as she lived: This she said and a great deal more of the like nature, and<br>
all of it with such affection, sorrow, relenting, grief, and mourning, as that it exceeds any pen<br>
for to describe and expresse the same.</p>
<p>Goodwife Wilson said, that she was in the dark as to some things in her confession; yet<br>
she asserted that knowingly she never had familiarity with the devill; that knowingly she<br>
never consented to the afflicting of any person, &amp;c. However she said that truly she was in<br>
the dark as to the matter of her being a witch; and being ask’d how she was in the dark, she<br>
replyed that the afflicted persons crying out of her as afflicting them made her fearfull of<br>
herself, and that was all that made her say that she was in the dark.</p>
<p>Goodwife Bridges said, that she had confessed against herself things which were all<br>
utterly false, and that she was brought to her confession by being told that she certainly was a<br>
witch, and so made to believe it, though she had no other grounds so to believe.</p>
<p>Goodwife Marston said, that she had a burthen upon her conscience, and that she had<br>
been burthened ever since she had made her confession, for she had wronged the truth and<br>
belyed herself; she never was guilty of witchcraft, or having to do with the devill (as she knew<br>
of) in her life time.</p>
<p>Sarah Churchill knew not whether it was in the day time or night time, that she stuck<br>
the thorns in the three poppets.</p>
<p>Hannah Post said, that Margaret Jacobs was choking of S. Ch. and that she appeared as<br>
little as a child of two years old.</p>
<p>Mary Post told the old story of her spirit’s riding upon the rail; but <strong><em>*</em></strong>****</p>
