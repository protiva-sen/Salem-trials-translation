<p>[? August 29, 1692 ]</p>
<p>Nextly, I will insert the Confession of a man about Forty years of Age, W. B., which he wrote<br>
himself in Prison, and sent to the Magistrates, to confirm his former Confession to them,<br>
viz.  </p>
<p>God having called me to Confess my sin and Apostasy in that fall  in giving the Devil advantage over me appearing to me like a Black,  in the evening to set my hand to his Book, as I have owned to my  shame. He told me that I should not want so doing. At Salem Village, there being a little off the Meeting-House, about an hundred five  Blades, some with Rapiers by their side, which was called and might be more for ought I know by <a href="/tag/george_burroughs_rev.html">B[urroughs]</a> and <a href="/tag/john_busse_rev.html">Bu[sse]</a> and the Trumpet  sounded, and Bread and Wine which they called the Sacrament, but I had none; being carried all over on a Stick, never being at any other Meeting. I being at Cart a Saturday last, all the day, of Hay and English  Corn, the Devil brought my Shape to Salem, and did afflict <a href="/tag/sprague_martha.html">M[artha] S[prague]</a>  and <a href="/tag/foster_rose.html">R[ose] F[oster]</a> by clitching my hand; and a Sabbath day my Shape afflicted <a href="/tag/martin_abigail.html">A[bigail] M[artin]</a> and at night afflic-  ted <a href="/tag/sprague_martha.html">M[artha] S[prague]</a> and <a href="/tag/martin_abigail.html">A[bigail] M[artin]</a> . <a href="/tag/johnson_elizabeth_jr.html">E[lizabeth] J[ohnson ]</a>  and <a href="/tag/faulkner_abigail_sr.html">A[bigail] F[aulkner]</a> have been my Enticers to this great  abomination, as one have owned and charged her to her Sister with  the same. And the and then all will be well. And now I hope God  in some measure has made me something sensible of my sin and apostasy, begging pardon of God, and of the Honourable Magistrates and  all Gods people, hoping and promising by the help of God, to set to  my heart and hand to do what in me lyeth to destroy such wicked  worship, humbly begging the prayers of all Gods People for me, I  may walk humbly under this great affliction and that I may procure to my self, the sure mercies of David, and the blessing of Abraham.</p>
