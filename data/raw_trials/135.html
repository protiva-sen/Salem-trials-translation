At a Court in Salem Village<br>
<a href="/tag/hathorn_john.html">John Hauthorne</a> ] Esq'rs<br>
<a href="/tag/corwin_jonathan.html">Jonath: Corwin</a> ] Esq'rs</p>
<p>As soon as she was coming towards the Bar the afflicted fell into fits.<br>
<a href="/tag/warren_mary.html">Mary Warren</a>, You stand here charged with sundry acts of Witchcraft, what do you say for your self, are you guilty, or not?</p>
<p>I am inocent. </p>
<p>Hath she hurt you (speaking to the sufferers) Some were Dumb. <a href="/tag/hubbard_elizabeth.html">Betty Hubbard</a> testifyed ag'st her, &amp; then said <a href="/tag/hubbard_elizabeth.html">Hubbard</a> fell into a violent fit.</p>
<p>You were a little while ago an Afflicted person, now you are an Afflicter: How comes this to pass? </p>
<p>I looke up to God &amp; take it to be a great Mercy of God. </p>
<p>What do you take it to be a great mercy to afflict others? </p>
<p><a href="/tag/hubbard_elizabeth.html">Betty Hubbard</a> testifyed that a little after this <a href="/tag/warren_mary.html">Mary</a> was well, she the said <a href="/tag/warren_mary.html">Mary</a>, said that the afflicted persons did but dissemble.</p>
<p>Now they were all but <a href="/tag/indian_john.html">John Indian</a> grievously afflicted, &amp; <a href="/tag/pope_bathshua.html">M'rs Pope</a> also, who was not afflicted before hitherto this day: &amp; after a few moments <a href="/tag/indian_john.html">John Indian</a> fell into a violent fit also.</p>
<p>Well here was one just now that was a Tormentor in her apparition, &amp; she owns that she had made a league with the Devil.<br>
Now <a href="/tag/warren_mary.html">Mary Warren</a> fell into a fit, &amp; some of the afflicted cryed out that she was going to confess, but <a href="/tag/corey_martha.html">Goody Korey</a> , &amp; <a href="/tag/proctor_john.html">Procter</a> , &amp; his wife came in, in their apparition, &amp; struck her down, &amp; said she should tell nothing.</p>
<p><a href="/tag/warren_mary.html">Mary Warren</a> continued a good space in a fit, #(the) that she did neither see, nor hear, nor speak.<br>
Afterwards she started up, &amp; said I will speak &amp; cryed out, Oh! I am sorry for it, I am sorry for it, &amp; wringed her hands, &amp; fell a little while into a fit again: &amp; then came to speak, but immediately her Teeth were set, &amp; then she fell into a voilet fit, &amp; cryed out, Oh Lord help me, Oh good Lord save me! </p>
<p>And then afterwards cryed again, I will tell, I will tell, &amp; then fell into a dead fit againe. </p>
<p>And afterwards cryed, I will tell, they did, they did, they did, &amp; then fell into a violent fit again. </p>
<p>After a little recovery she cryed I will tell, I will tell, they brought me me to it; &amp; then fell into a fit again: which fits continuing, she was ordered to be had out, &amp; the next to be brought in, viz: <a href="/tag/bishop_bridget.html">Bridget Byshop</a></p>
<p>Some time afterwards she was called in again, but immediately taken with fits, for a while. </p>
<p>Have you signed the Devils book? </p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Have you not toucht it?<br>
No.</p>
<p>Then she fell into fits againe, &amp; was sent forth for air.</p>
<p>After a considerable space of time she was brought in again, but could [not] give account of things, by reason of fits, &amp; so sent forth. </p>
<p><a href="/tag/warren_mary.html">Mary Warren</a> called in, afterwards in private, before Magistrates &amp; Ministers.</p>
<p>She said, I shall not speak a word: but I will, #(speak) I will speak satan -- she saith she will kill me. Oh! `she saith, she owes me a spite, &amp; will claw me off -- </p>
<p>Avoid Satan, for the name of God avoid. And then fell into fits again: &amp; cryed will ye; I will prevent ye in the Name of God,<br>
Tell us, how far have you yeilded? </p>
<p>A fit interrupts her again. </p>
<p>What did they say you should do, &amp; you should be well? </p>
<p>Then her lips were bit so that she could not speak. so she was sent away </p>
<p>Note  That not one of the sufferers was afflicted during her examination after once she began to confess, tho they were tormented before.</p>

A: Then I thought it was the Devil's book. Q. How did you come to know your Master, and Mistris were Witches? A. The Sabbath Even after I had put up my note for thanks in publick, my Mistris appeared to mee, and puld mee out of the Bed, and told mee that Shee was a witch and had put her hand to the Book, she told me this in her Bodily person, and that This Examinant might have known she was a Witch, if she had but minded what Books she read in.<br>
Q. what did she say to you before you tormented the Children?  A. The night after she told mee she was a Witch, she in person told mee this Examinant, that my self and her son John would quickly be brought out for witches. This Examinant saith that <a href="/tag/corey_giles.html">Giles Cory</a> in apparition told her, the night before that the Magistrates were goeing up to the farms to bring down more witches to torment her.
