<p>The Examination of <a href="/tag/jacobs_george_sr.html">Geo: Jacobs Sen'r</a> 10 May. 1692  </p>
<p>Here are them that accuse you of acts of witchcraft<br>
Well, let us hear who are they, and what are they.<br>
<a href="/tag/williams_abigail.html">Abigail Williams</a> - <a href="/tag/jacobs_george_sr.html">Jacobs</a> laught.<br>
Because I am falsely accused. -- Your worships all of you do you think this is true?<br>
Nay, what do you think?<br>
I never did it.<br>
who did it?<br>
Don't ask me.<br>
Why should we not ask you? <a href="/tag/churchill_sarah.html">Sarah Churchwell</a> accuseth you, there she is.<br>
I am as innocent as the Child born to night, I have lived. 33. years here in Salem.<br>
What then?<br>
If you can prove that I am guilty, I will lye under it,<br>
<a href="/tag/churchill_sarah.html">Sarah Churchwell</a> said last night I was afflicted at <a href="/tag/ingersoll_nathaniel.html">Deacon Ingersolls</a> , and <a href="/tag/walcott_mary.html">Mary Walcot</a> said it was a man with 2 staves, it was my<br>
        Master.<br>
Pray do not accuse me, I am as clear as your Worships; you must do right judgments.<br>
What book did he bring you<a href="/tag/churchill_sarah.html">Sarah</a>?<br>
The same that the other woman brought.<br>
The Devill can go in any shape.<br>
Did he not [be] appear on the other side of the river and hurt you, did not you see him.<br>
Yes he did.<br>
Look there, she accuseth you to your face, she chargeth you that you hurt her twise. Is it not true?<br>
What would you have me say? I never wronged no man in word nor deed.<br>
Here are 3 evidences.<br>
You tax me for a wizard, you may as well tax me for a buzard I have done no harm.<br>
Is it no harm to afflict these?<br>
I never did it.<br>
But how comes it to be in your appearance?<br>
The Devil can taken any likeness.<br>
Not without their consent.<br>
Please your worship it is untrue, I never showed the book, I am as silly about these things as the child born last night.<br>
That is your Saying, you argue you have lived so long, but what then Cain might live long before he killed Abel, &amp; you might live long before the Devill had so prevailed on you.<br>
Christ hath suffered .3. times for me.<br>
What three times<br>
He suffered the Crosse, &amp; gall --<br>
You had as good confesse (said <a href="/tag/churchill_sarah.html">Sarah Churchwell</a>) if you are guilty.<br>
Have you heard that I have any witchcraft?<br>
I know you lived a wicked life.<br>
Let her make it out.<br>
Doth he ever pray in his family?<br>
Not unless by himself.  </p>
<p>Why do you not pray in your family?<br>
I cannot read.<br>
Well but you may pray for all that. Can you say the Lords prayer?<br>
Let us hear you?<br>
He mist in severall parts of it, &amp; could not repeat it right after many trialls<br>
<a href="/tag/churchill_sarah.html">Sarah Churchwell</a>, when you wrote in the book you was showed your Masters name you said.<br>
Yes Sir.<br>
If she say so, if you do not know it, what will you say?<br>
But she saw you, or your likeness tempt her to write.<br>
One in my likeness, the Devil may present my likeness.<br>
Were you not frighted <a href="/tag/churchill_sarah.html">Sarah Churchwell</a>, when the representation of your master came to you?<br>
Yes.<br>
Well: burn me, or hang me, I will stand in the truth of Christ, I know nothing of it.<br>
Do you know nothing of getting your son <a href="/tag/jacobs_george_jr.html">George</a> &amp; his daughter <a href="/tag/jacobs_margaret.html">Margaret</a> to signe?<br>
No nothing at all. </p>

<a href="/tag/walcott_mary.html">Mary Walcot</a> is this the man?<br>

No I know it not, if I were to dye presently.<br>
<a href="/tag/lewis_mercy.html">Mercy Lewes</a> went to come near him but fell into great fits.<br>
<a href="/tag/lewis_mercy.html">Mercy Lewes</a> testimony read. What do you say to this?<br>
Why it is false, I know not of it, any more than the child that was born to night.<br>
<a href="/tag/putnam_ann_jr.html">Ann Putman</a> said yes, you told me so, that you had been so this .40. years.<br>
<a href="/tag/putnam_ann_jr.html">Ann Putman</a> &amp; <a href="/tag/williams_abigail.html">Abigail Williams</a> had each of them a pin stuck in their hands, &amp; they said it was this old <a href="/tag/jacobs_george_sr.html">Jacobs</a> .<br>
