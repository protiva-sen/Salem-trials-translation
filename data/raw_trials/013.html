<p>I am no Witch. </p>
<p>Why if you have not wrote in the book, yet tell me how far you  have gone? Have you not to do with familiar Spirits?</p>
<p>I have no familiarity with the Devil. </p>
<p>How is it then, that your appearance doth hurt these? </p>
<p>I am innocent. </p>
<p>Why you seem to act Witchcraft before us, by the motion of your body, which #[hasin] seems to have influence fluence upon the afflicted.</p>
<p>I know nothing of it. I am innocent to a Witch. I know not what  a Witch is.</p>
<p>How do you know then that you are not a witch? #[and yet know not what a Witch is?] </p>
<p>I do not #[understand] know what you say. </p>

<p>You may threaten, but you can do no more than you are permitted.</p>
<p>I am innocent of a Witch. </p>
<p>What do you say of those murders you are charged with? </p>
<p>I hope, I am not guilty of Murder. </p>
<p>Then she turned up her eyes, &amp; #[they] the eyes of the afflicted were turned up</p>
<p>It may be you do not know, that any have confessed to day, who  have been examined before you, that they are Witches.</p>
