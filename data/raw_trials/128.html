<p>After many questiones and negative answe's returned and her stricking down of severall of the afflicted persones with her looks, she was desired to tell the truth in this matter She then said that this may last she was under great discontentedness &amp; troubled w'h feare about the Indians, &amp; used often to dream of figheting with them. Being asked what was the devils temptation under her discontentm't She said she would confess if she could But that there was something at her breast that hindered her. she said she had often prayed but thought she was the worse for prayeing and knows not but that the devil hes tempted her not to pray, for #(my) her breath has been often stopt as it was just now; Being asked if the devil did not Desier her to renounce her baptisme, she answered that she had thoughts she was rather the worse for her baptisme and has wished she had not been baptised because she had not improved it as she ought to have done She saith she used to get into a corner alone and desired to pray but her mouth would be stopt but sometymes she had been helped to say Lord be mercifull to me a sinner. Being again asked how far she had yeilded to Satan she said the devil promised her she should not be discovered and if she wer discovered &amp; brought down that she should goe home Innocent &amp; cleare but now find he hes deluded her Being again asked how long it is since Satan first wrought with her in this manner she said she could not well tell how long but thinks it is not two year(s)<br>

And he promised if she would serve him she should be safe from the Indians (she was then a litle stopt again &amp; believed it was the devil that did it) Being asked if the Devil did not say she was to serve him Answered yes, and signed the mark upon that condition and was to praise him w'h her whole heart, And it was to that appearance she prayed at all tymes for he said he was able to delyver her from the Indians And it was the feare of the Indians that put her upon it<br>
She confesses she hurt <a href="/tag/swan_timothy.html">Timothy Swan</a> and thinks she was twice at salem Village witch meeting and that<a href="/tag/bridges_sarah.html">bridges</a> was one of her company -- she said as she came along in order to examinan she promised herself twenty tymes by the way (but fea's it was to the devil) That if she should dye upon the Gallowse yet she would not say any thing but that she was Innocent And rejoyced In the thought of it that she should goe home Innocent, -- she saith that <a href="/tag/green_mary.html">Goody Green</a> and <a href="/tag/bromage_hannah.html">Goody Broomage</a> were also her companions and that <a href="/tag/bromage_hannah.html">Broomage</a> afflicted <a href="/tag/swan_timothy.html">Swan</a> by squeezeing his armes, And is afrayd that she the s'd <a href="/tag/toothaker_mary.html">toothaker</a> squeezed his throat -- she said further that when <a href="/tag/bridges_sarah.html">Goody Bridges</a> (who had confessed before) urged her also to confess she had then no remembrance of this but with the justices discourse and the help of god it came into her mynd. She saith she thought that that appearance was God her creator &amp; being asked if she did not know otherwise answered The devil is so subtil that when she would confess he stops her and deluds also by scripture and being asked what scripture he made use of to her she mentioned that in the psalms where it is said Let my enemies be confounded, And so shee hes wished them all Destroyed that raised such reports of her--She confesses that her sister was with her at all the meetings &amp; particularly at Salem Village &amp; there went with her <a href="/tag/bridges_sarah.html">Goody Bridges</a> <a href="/tag/foster_rose.html">Goody foster</a> <a href="/tag/green_mary.html">Goody Green</a> &amp; <a href="/tag/bromage_hannah.html">Goody broomage</a> Severall afflicted persones said they saw the black man before her in the tyme of her examination And she now herself confesses  she saw him upon the table before her She sayes further there was a minister a litle man whose name is <a href="/tag/burroughs_george.html">Burroughs</a> that preached at the village meeting of witches, and she heard that they used bread &amp; wine at these meetings And that they did talk of 305 witches in the countrey she sayth their discourse was about the pulling down the Kingdome of christ and setting up the Kingdom of Satan, And also Knew <a href="/tag/how_elizabeth.html">Goody How</a> among the rest Being asked if their was not a woman that stirred them up to afflict <a href="/tag/swan_timothy.html">swan</a> Answered yes there was a pretty elderly woman that was most busie about him and encouraged the rest to afflict him.
