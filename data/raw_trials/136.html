I am not guilty Sir.<br>
Is this the woman? speaking to the afflict[ed]<br>
Thay all, or most, said yes, &amp; then fell into fits.<br>
What do you say, are you guil[ty]<br>
I am not guilty Sir.<br>
Is this the woman? speaking to the afflicted<br>
They all, or most, said yes,&amp; then fell into fits<br>
I thank God I am free.<br>
Here is a clear evidence that [you have] been not only a Tormenter<br>
[but that] You have caused one to sig[ne the] book, the night before last<br>
[What do]you say to this?<br>
I never saw the book in my life and I never saw these persons before<br>

All fell into fits, &amp; con[firmed] that the accused hurt th[em]<br>

[W]hat say you, are you guilty or not?<br>
[I] can speak in the presence of God safely, as<br>
[I] must look to give account another day, that I am as clear as a new born babe.<br>
Clear: of what?<br>
Of Witchcraft<br>
Have you never hurt these?<br>
No.<br>
Have you not consented that they should be hurt?<br>
<a href="/tag/williams_abigail.html">Abigail Williams</a> said, he was going to <a href="/tag/lewis_mercy.html">Mercy Lewes</a>, &amp; quickly after said <a href="/tag/lewis_mercy.html">Lewes</a> was seized with a fit.<br>

Then they fell into fits &amp; halloo'd [and]<br>
[suffe]red greatly.<br>

[I h]urt none of<br>
[T]hen they all fell into great fits again<br>
When were you at any publick Religious meeting<br>
Not a pretty while<br>
Why so?<br>
Because I was not well: I had a distemper that none knows.<br>
Can you act Witchcraft here, &amp; by casting your eyes turn folks into fits?<br>
You may judge your pleasure, my soul is clear.<br>
Do you not see you hurt these by your look<br>
No. I do not know it.<br>
You did not answere to that question, dont you over-look them?<br>
No I don't over-look them.<br>
What do you call that way of looking upon persons, &amp; striking them downe?<br>
You may judge your pleasure.<br>
Well but what do you call it?<br>
It was none of I.<br>
Who was it then?<br>
I cannot tell who they are.<br>
Why they say, they see you going to hurt persons &amp; immediatly hurt persons.<br>
Abig: Williams said he is going to hurt <a href="/tag/lewis_mercy.html">Mercy Lewes</a> [torn] &amp; imediately s'd <a href="/tag/lewis_mercy.html">Mercy</a> fell into a fit, &amp; divers others<br>
Can you now deny it?<br>
I can deny it to my dying day.<br>
What is the reason you go away when [there] is any reading of the Scripture in your [family]<br>
He denyed it.<br>
<a href="/tag/ingersoll_nathaniel.html">Nathanael Ingersol</a> &amp; <a href="/tag/haynes_thomas.html">Tho: Haynes</a> tes[tifyed] that this Hobb's daughter had told them [so] As soon as your daughter <a href="/tag/hobbs_abigail.html">Abigail</a> , &amp; aft [torn] to day your wife confessed they left torturing &amp; so would you, if you would confess: can you still deny that you are guilty?<br>
I am not guilty.<br>
If you put away Gods ordinances, no wonder that the Devil prevails with you. to keep his counsell. Have you never had any apparition.<br>
No Sir.<br>
Did you never pray to the Devill that your daughter might confess no more?<br>
No Sir.<br>
Who do you[r] wo[r] ship?<br>
I hope I worship God only.<br>
Where?<br>
In my heart.<br>
But God requires outward worship [torn]<br>
not worship him in publick, ne [torn]<br>

No Sir.<br>
Do you think she is a witch now<br>
I do not know.<br>
Well if you desire mercy from God, own the truth.<br>
I do not know anything of that nature.<br>
What do you think these people aile?<br>
More than ordinary?<br>
But what more than ordinary<br>

Why do you not answer what do they aile?<br>
I do not know what they aile I am sorry<br>
It is none of I.<br>

Do you think they are bewitcht.<br>
I cannot tell<br>
Not tell when your wife &amp; daughter o [torn]<br>
