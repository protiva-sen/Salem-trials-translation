<p>We met in a green, which was the minister's pasture - we were in two companies at last. I think there was a few men with them. - I heard <a href="/tag/good_sarah.html">Sarah Good</a> talk of a minister or two. One of them was she that had been at the eastward; his name is <a href="/tag/burroughs_george.html">Burroughs</a>, and is a little man. -I remember not the other's name.</p>
