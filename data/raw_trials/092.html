<p>As soon as she came in Many had fits.<br>
Do you know this Woman<br>
<a href="/tag/williams_abigail.html">Abig: Williams</a> saith it is <a href="/tag/martin_susannah.html">Goody Martin</a> she hath hurt me often. Others by fits were hindered from speaking.<br>
<a href="/tag/hubbard_elizabeth.html">Eliz: Hubbard</a> said she hath not been hurt by her. <a href="/tag/indian_john.html">John Indian</a> said he hath not seen her  <a href="/tag/lewis_mercy.html">Mercy Lewes</a> pointed to her &amp; fell into a little fit. <a href="/tag/putnam_ann_jr.html">Ann Putman</a> threw her Glove in a fit at her<br>
  The examinant laught.<br>
What do you laugh at it?<br>
Well I may at such folly.<br>
Is this folly? The hurt of these persons?<br>
I never hurt man woman or child.<br>
<a href="/tag/lewis_mercy.html">Mercy Lewes</a> cryed out she hath hurt me a great many times, &amp; pulls me down<br>
    Then <a href="/tag/martin_susannah.html">Martin</a> laught againe<br>
<a href="/tag/walcott_mary.html">Mary Walcot</a> saith this woman hath hurt me a great many times. <a href="/tag/sheldon_susannah.html">Sus: Sheldon</a> also accused her of afflicting her.<br>
What do you say to this?<br>
I have no hand in Witchcraft.<br>
What did you do? Did not you give your consent?<br>
No, never in my life.<br>
What ails this people?<br>
I do not know.<br>
But w't do you think?<br>
I do not desire to spend my judgm't upon it.<br>
Do not you think they are Bewitcht?<br>
No. I do not think they are<br>
Tell me your thoughts about them.<br>
Why my thoughts are my own, when they are in, but when they are out they are anothers.<br>
You said their Master -- who do you think is their Master?<br>
If they be dealing in the black art, you may know as well as I.<br>
Well what have you done towards this?<br>
Nothing.<br>
Why it is you, or your appearance.<br>
I cannot help it.<br>
That may be your Master.<br>
I desire to lead my self according to the #[will of God] word of God.<br>
Is this according to Gods word?<br>
If I were such a person I would tell you the truth.<br>
How comes your appearance just now to hurt these.<br>
How do I know?<br>
Are not you willing to tell the Truth?<br>
I cannot tell: He that appeared in sams shape a glorifyed saint can appear in any ones shape.<br>
Do you beleive these do not say true?<br>
They may lye for ought I know<br>
May not you lye?<br>
I dare not tell a lye if it would save my life.<br>
Then you will speak the Truth.<br>
[lost =I] I have spake nothing else, I would do them any good.<br>
I do not think you have such affections for them, whom just now you insinuated had the Devill for their Master.<br>
<a href="/tag/hubbard_elizabeth.html">Eliz: Hubbard</a> was afflicted &amp; then the Marshal w'o was by her said she pincht her hand.<br>
Severall of the afflicted cryed out they [lost =saw] her upon the beam.<br>
Pray God discover you, if you be guilty.<br>
Amen. Amen. A false tongue will never make a guilty person.<br>
You have been a long time coming to the Court to day, you can come fast enough in the night.said <a href="/tag/lewis_mercy.html">Mercy Lewes</a>.<br>
No, sweet heart, said the examinat, And then <a href="/tag/lewis_mercy.html">Mercy Lewes</a> , &amp; all, or many of the rest, were afflicted<br>
<a href="/tag/indian_john.html">John Indian</a> fell into a violent fit, &amp; said it was that woman, she bites, she bites, and then she was biting her lips<br>
Have you not compassion for these afflicted?<br>
No, I have none<br>
Some cryed out there was the black man with her, &amp; <a href="/tag/bibber_sara.html">Goody Bibber</a> who had not accused her before confirmed it.<br>
<a href="/tag/williams_abigail.html">Abig: William</a> upon trial could not come near her -- Nor <a href="/tag/bibber_sara.html">Goody Bibber</a>. Nor <a href="/tag/walcott_mary.html">Mary Walcot.</a> <a href="/tag/indian_john.html">John Indian</a> cryed he would Kill her if he came near her, but he was flung down in his approach to her<br>
What is the reason these cannot come near you?<br>
I cannot tell. It may be the Devil bears me more malice than an other<br>
Do not you see how God evidently discovers you?<br>
No, not a bit for that.<br>
All the congregation think so.<br>
Let them think w't. they will.<br>
What is the reason these cannot come near you?<br>
I do not know but they can if they will or else if you please, I will come to them.<br>
What is the black man whispering to you?<br>
There was none whispered to me </p>

Do you think they are Bewitcht?<br>
No I do not think they are.<br>
Well tell us your thoughts about them?<br>
My thoughts are mine own when they are in, but when they are out they are an others<br>
You said their Master -- Who do you think is their Master?<br>
If they be dealing in the black art, you may know as well as I.<br>
What have you done towards the hurt of these?<br>
I have done nothing<br>
Why it is you, or your appearance<br>
I cannot help it<br>
That may be your Master that hurt them<br>
I desire to lead my life according to the word of God<br>
Is this according to the word of God?<br>
If I were such a person I would tell you the Truth<br>
How comes your appearance just now to hurt these?<br>
How do I know?<br>
Are you not willing to tell the Truth?<br>
I cannot tell: He that appeared in sams::shape can appear in any ones shape.<br>
Do you beleive these afflicted persons do not say true?<br>
they may lye for ought I know.<br>
May not you lye?<br>
I dare not tell a lye if it would save my life<br>
Then you will not speak the truth will you?<br>
I have spoken nothing else. I would do them any good.<br>
I do not think that you have such affections for these whom just now you insinuated had the Devil for their Master<br>
The marshall said she pincht her hands &amp; <a href="/tag/hubbard_elizabeth.html">Eliz: Hubbard</a> was immediately afflicted.<br>
Severall of the afflicted cryed out they saw her upon the Beam.<br>
Pray God discover you if you be guilty.<br>
Amen, Amen. A false tongue will never make a guilty person.<br>
You have been a long time coming to day said <a href="/tag/lewis_mercy.html">Mercy Lewes</a>, you can come fast enough in the night<br>
No sweet heart --<br>
And then said <a href="/tag/lewis_mercy.html">Mercy</a>, &amp; all the afflicted beside almost were afflicted<br>
<a href="/tag/indian_john.html">John Indian</a> fell into a fit, &amp; cryed it was that woman, she bites, she bites. And then said <a href="/tag/martin_susannah.html">Martin</a> was biting her lips.<br>
Have not you compassion on these afflicted --<br>
No I have none<br>
They cryed out there was the black man along with her, &amp; <a href="/tag/bibber_sara.html">Goody Bibber</a> confirmed it<br>
<a href="/tag/williams_abigail.html">Abig: Williams</a> went towards her, but could not come near her. nor<a href="/tag/bibber_sara.html">Goody Bibber</a> tho she had not accused her before: also <a href="/tag/walcott_mary.html">Mary Walcot</a> could not come near her. <a href="/tag/indian_john.html">John Indian</a> said he would kill her, if he came near her, but he fell down before he could touch her<br>
What is the reason these cannot come near you?<br>
I cannot tell it may be the Devil bears me more malice than an other.<br>
Do you not see God evidently discovering you?<br>
No, not a bit for that.<br>
All the congregation besides think so.<br>
Let them think what they will.<br>
What is the reason these cannot come to you?<br>
I do not know but they can if they will or else if you please,<br>
I will come to them.<br>
What was that the black man whisperd to you?<br>
There was none whispered to me. </p>
